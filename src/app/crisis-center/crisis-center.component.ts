/**
 * The CrisisCenterComponent is much like the AppComponent shell.

 * It is a shell for the crisis management feature area just as 
 * the AppComponent is a shell to manage the high-level workflow.
 * It is dead simple â€” simpler even than the AppComponent template. 
 * It has no content, no links, just a <router-outlet> for the
 * Crisis Center child views.
